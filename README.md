# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose:
- Using Kickstarter data, this analysis compared how theater campaigns faired given their launch date and their funding goals in an effort to provide my friend Louise with the optimal time to launch her own venture.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
- Based on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date analysis, I discovered that the summer months (May - July) could be the optimal time to begin a theater Kickstarter campaign given the high number of successful ventures, especially in the month of May.
- On the other hand, campaigns started at the end of the year seem to be the least successful, especially in the month of December where there are near equal amounts of successful and failed campaigns.

### Outcomes Based on Goals:
- Looking at the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis, I discovered lower funding goals typically lead to greater success, with at least 50% of campaigns designated as successful when having a fundraising goal between $1,000 and $19,999.
- The highest rate of success occurred in the theater campaigns that had a goal of less than $5,000, where at least 73% of the campaigns were successfully funded.

### Limitations of the Dataset:
- Some limitations include:
  - dfadf
